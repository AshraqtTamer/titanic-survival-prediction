# Titanic Survival Prediction

A Jupyter Notebook–based project for exploring the Titanic passenger dataset and building models to predict passenger survival.

Repository snapshot
- Primary language: Jupyter Notebook (notebooks are the main code artifacts).
- Owner: @AshraqtTamer
- Repo: titanic-survival-prediction

What this project contains
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning & feature engineering
- One or more classification models (baseline + tuned)
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Reproducible analysis designed to run inside Jupyter

Repository structure
- data/
  - titanic.csv            — (expected) CSV dataset used by the notebooks. Place or keep the dataset here.
- notebooks/
  - 00-data-exploration.ipynb       — EDA and initial observations
  - 01-preprocessing.ipynb         — Data cleaning, missing-value handling, feature engineering
  - 02-modeling.ipynb              — Modeling pipeline, training, cross-validation
  - 03-evaluation-and-interpretation.ipynb — Metrics, confusion matrices, ROC, SHAP or other explainability tools
  - (other notebooks may exist; run in recommended order)
- src/ (optional)              — Shared helper modules (functions used by notebooks)
- models/ (optional)           — Pickled / serialized trained models and artifacts
- README.md                    — This file
- requirements.txt (recommended) — Pin Python package versions used by notebooks
- environment.yml (optional)   — Conda environment file for reproducibility

Dataset
- Expected location: data/titanic.csv
- Required columns: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
- Notes: The dataset contains missing values (commonly Age, Cabin, Embarked). The notebooks contain imputation and handling strategies.

Quick start (local)
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/AshraqtTamer/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction

2. Create and activate an environment
   - pip
     python -m venv venv
     # macOS / Linux
     source venv/bin/activate
     # Windows
     venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
   - or conda
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     conda activate titanic-survival

3. Start Jupyter and open notebooks
   jupyter lab
   # or
   jupyter notebook
   Open notebooks/ and run them in order (00 → 01 → 02 → 03). Save outputs as you go.

Loading the dataset (example)
```python
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

DATA_PATH = Path("data/titanic.csv")
df = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH)
df.head()
```

Run notebooks programmatically (recommended for reproducibility)
- Use papermill to parameterize and execute notebooks in sequence (helpful for CI or automated runs):
  papermill notebooks/00-data-exploration.ipynb output/00-data-exploration-output.ipynb
  papermill notebooks/01-preprocessing.ipynb output/01-preprocessing-output.ipynb
  papermill notebooks/02-modeling.ipynb output/02-modeling-output.ipynb

Modeling & evaluation
- Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- Recommended metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC.
- Use stratified cross-validation for reliable evaluation.
- Compare simple baselines (e.g., logistic regression) with stronger learners (random forest, gradient boosting).
- Track experiments (notebooks, parameters, and key metrics). Consider MLflow or a small experiments folder for results.

Reproducibility suggestions
- Add requirements.txt (or environment.yml) with pinned versions used during development.
- Save random seeds and model artifacts in models/ with a short metadata file describing training parameters.
- Convert long-running steps into scripts (scripts/) so CI can run them deterministically.

Project best practices
- Keep heavy computation out of notebooks when possible. Use notebooks for exploration and visualization; move pipelines into src/ for testability.
- Add small unit tests for helper functions in src/ and run them in CI.
- Use consistent relative paths (project root) in notebooks, or set a single notebook cell that sets up Path variables.

Suggested requirements (example)
```
pandas>=1.3
numpy>=1.21
scikit-learn>=1.0
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyterlab
xgboost  # optional
papermill  # optional, for running notebooks programmatically
```

Continuous integration (optional)
- Add a lightweight CI workflow that:
  - Installs dependencies
  - Runs unit tests (if added)
  - Executes core notebooks with papermill (or runs scripts for preprocessing/modeling)
  - Validates that produced model artifacts and notebooks outputs are present

Contributing
- Add or update notebooks following the numbering convention (00-*, 01-*, ...).
- Move reusable code into src/ and add tests.
- Open issues or pull requests describing changes and expected outcomes.
- Include reproducible steps for any non-trivial changes.

License
- No license file included by default. Add LICENSE (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0) to make the repository's terms explicit.
